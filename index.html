                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <strong><small>"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me"~ Phillipians 4:13</small></strong>
        
                <p>Hello everyone! My name is Shannon Melvin and it is an extreme pleasure of mine to be on this journey with you. I am very excited about this new journey we have embarked on for the next 3 months. Well let me start off by telling you guys a few things about me. 
                    I was born and raised in Albany,Ga but I now currently reside in the Houston,Texas area. I am 34 years of age and a proud believer of Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior. I am married to a beautiful woman by the name of Sharon Melvin and through our love each other we produced 3 beautiful children.
                    Thus, the reason why I am here. My family is definitely the number one reasons why I am in this program. I am ready to learn a new skill that I can utilize by providing companies who are in need of my expertise a tremendous amount of value. In return for my services and value, I can earn a nice decent salary to provide a better life for my family.
                    I am very excited and happy to here. I am very eager to learn, network, and meet my fellow instructors and classmates. And most importantly I am excited to finish the program and earn my certificate as a software engineer.  To God be the Glory!

                <p> As you can see I am a big basketball fan! The Lakers is my favorite basketball team. I've been a Lakers fan. I didn't become one just because Lebron plays for us now like a lot of people. The legend Kobe Bryant is my favorite basketball player of all-time! Don't get me wrong I love Mj, Lebron, and Curry but Kobe just does it for me.
                 Outside of that I am a big sports fan in general. I just love being active and against others.  I love exercising. I love running and being outdoors. I love to read. I am a big book advocate. I love music. I listen to all kinds. I also love creating music. I haven't been in the studio in a while but it is still in me. I play the sax,drums, and piano. I love to sing and rap. I love to dance. I love spending time with my family. I definitely love date nights! I will never get tired of those! And most importantly I love spending time with God!  </p>
